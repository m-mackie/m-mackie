Currently, contributing to dynamic web development projects using React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Express, and RESTful APIs! Feel free to check out my pinned projects or connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more.

- 💁 I’m building my professional portfolio, its a work in progress :D
- 🎨 I have two passion projects I am working on. One is for family. It is an e-commerce site for their small business (it is in brainstorm stage) waiting on my parents to decide on colors and branding, the other is a blog for myself to showcase my different hobbies (also in brainstorm stage) I am currently working on the art and branding. 
- 📃 I’m currently learning ...Liquid and reinforcing my knowledge of the fundamentals: CSS, HTML, and JSS. I am interested in learning how to develop Emails using JS, CSS and HTML.
- 👯 I’m interested in collaborating on open source projects
- 📝 I am always looking for new ways to grow and learn

Moving over from a long career in customer service, billing, and retail. In 2019 I enrolled as a student at Lambda School learning full stack web development. I am currently set to earn my endorsement this month (May 2023). I enjoy various creative hobbies that I look to blend in with my work, such as photography and graphic design. Likewise, I also enjoy writing short stories, reading and appreciating art of almost any kind
